# Docker Ansible role

This role installs Docker on the remote machine.

Requirements:
 - Debian-based distro

Role was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 Vagrant VM, that is located in the "<repo root>/vagrant/empty".

This role is based on Jeff Geerling's Docker role. Some parts were cut out and more comments were added.
