# Docker configuration

`app_python` directory contains `Dockerfile` that builds app image and `build_docker.sh` script as a shorthand for running `docker build` with `latest` tag.

Official Python docker image is used as a base for this image.

Repository root contains `docker-compose` file to startup the project with all parameters.
