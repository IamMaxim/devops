# Non-confidential data

## ConfigMaps

I added `files/config.json` to the chart directory. Then, I created `configmaps.yaml` and added resource declaration there (reading the config file).

Then, I added volume and volumeMount to the deployment declaration and upgraded the chart.

Output of the file from the container:
```shell
> kubectl exec timeserver-5b97877fb-92x2n -- cat /app/config.json                                      
{
  "timeserver_config_key": "timeserver_config_value"
}
```
